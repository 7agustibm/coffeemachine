			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<img src="images/customer.jpeg" width="100" height = "125" style="float: right;"/>
			<p>This mini project is used to learn TDD.</p>
			<p>Of course, in your career, you have implemented more complicated stuff than a simple coffe machine that takes orders. But to make this mini project more interesting here are simple rules you <strong>must </strong>follow:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>All production code is written to make a failing test pass</li>
				<li>Do the simplest thing that could work for the current iteration</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<p>Are you ready? So read your assignement below and start the <a href="cm-first-iteration.html">first iteration</a>. Your product owner is waiting for you!</p>
			
			<h2>Project</h2>			
			<p>The Coffee Machine Project is about the implementation of the <span class="important">engine that receives commands</span> 
				from the user and that dispatches commands to the <span class="important">drink maker</span> according to the drink maker protocol. 
			</p>
			
			<p>This project starts simple and grow in added features through the iterations.</p>
			
			<h2>Drink maker protocol</h2>
			<p>The <span class="important">drink maker</span> receives commands to make the drinks and can deliver info messages 
			to the user. The instructions it receives follow this format:</p>
			<pre>T:1:0 ==> Drink maker makes 1 tea with 1 sugar and a stick</pre>
			<pre>H:: ==> Drink maker makes 1 chocolate with no sugar
	(and therefore no stick)</pre>
			<pre>C:2:0 ==> Drink maker makes 1 coffee with 2 sugars and a stick</pre>
			<pre>M:message content ==> Drink maker will forward the message 
			to the coffee machine console</pre>
			
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>All you need is:</p>
			<ul>
			 <li>A testing framework (junit, rspec, ...)</li>
			 <li>A mocking framework (mockito, ...)</li>
			 <li>A passion for tested code ;)</li>			 
			</ul>
