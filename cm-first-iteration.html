			<h2>First iteration</h2>
			<img src="images/coffee-cup.jpeg" width="66" height = "100" style="float: right;"/>
			
			<p>In this iteration, your job is to implement the <span class="important">engine</span> 
			that receives order from the user and that dispatches the command 
			to the <span class="important">drink maker</span> according to <a href="coffeemachine.html">drink maker protocol</a>.</p>
			<p>The coffee machine can serves 3 type of drinks: tea, coffee, chocolate.</p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<p>Your product owner has delivered the stories and here they are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to have a drink served when I pressed the corresponding drink button</li>
				<li>I want to be able to add one or two sugars</li>
				<li>When I have some sugar in my drink I want a stick (touillette) with it</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Implementation details</h2>
			<p>The implementation of the user order is up to you. For instance, it could be a bean that contains the order details of the user.</p>
