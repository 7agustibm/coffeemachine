			<p>The machine is becoming popular in the office. The management is eager to have daily reports
			of what is sold and when.</p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to be able to have a daily reports that contains the WHEN and WHAT of the consumption</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Implementation details</h2>
			<p>For the reporting, you can have a repository of data with a simple data structure in memory. A simple reporting can be done by printing 
			to the console. Of course all of that should be tested before it is written ;)</p>
